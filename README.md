# Image-recognition-using-keras-and-tensor-flow
This project demonstrates training a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images. Because it uses the Keras Sequential API.In this project, CIFAR10 dataset was used to train the model and used Tensorfow,keras and other important python libraries.
